# BeReal Date Tagger

Have you ever wanted to export your BeReals only to find out the images aren't sorted correctly by date?

Well I have. So I wrote this script to do the work for me

## Prerequisites

You need to request a copy of your data from BeReal. The images themselves don't contain the metadata however it is located in the json files that come along with it.

## Installation

TBA

## Usage

### A quick warning

~~Note that if you do not use the timezone parameter, the program will use your system's local time. This also means that BeReals taken in another timezone or several timezones will not be respected.~~ This feature is not even implemented yet, thus it will make use of UTC for now

### Example
